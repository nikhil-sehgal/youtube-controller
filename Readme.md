# YouTube Controller

## Summary:
* Lots of open tabs in chrome and listening songs on youtube is the beginning of this project.
* While doing work, I used to come across many situtaion when I had to play|pause or play next song in youtube and for that I had to switch tabs leaving my working tab. 
* So I thought what if I can control youtube from chrome browser that to without leaving working tab.
